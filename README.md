# Sparse factorization of the square all-ones matrix of arbitrary order

This repo is for the numerial experiments used in "Sparse factorization of the square all-ones matrix of arbitrary order" ([arxiv](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2401.14596v1)).

The main plotting file is `sparse_factorization.ipynb` and rest files are the supporting function implementations.
